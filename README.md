# Space Game 3
"Space Game" is my pet project, which I've been scrapping and restarting since 2008.

## Running

1. Clone into your Workspace.
2. Execute `mvn compile assembly:single` to pull in natives/ dependencies.
3. Add `-Djava.library.path=natives/target` to your IDEs VM Arguments.
4. Launch!

## Libraries

Space Game 3 is a Maven project and uses the Slick2D java library for rendering. The networking is done in pure Java.

## Previous Games

Space Game 1 and 2 hopefully exist on the web or a usb stick somewhere. But I'm not sure where :(
